# Linter Rule: Prefer `data-turbo-method` over the deprecated `data-method`

**Rule:** `ujs-prefer-turbo-method`

## Description

Disallow the `data-method` attribute and the Action View link helper options that render it, namely `method:` and `data: { method: ... }`. Use `data-turbo-method` or `data: { turbo_method: ... }` instead.

## Rationale

Before Rails 7, Rails shipped `@rails/ujs` by default, which added JavaScript behavior to elements through helper options and `data-*` attributes. Rails 7 stopped including it, and Turbo covers the same behavior with its own attributes.

`data-method` made `@rails/ujs` build a hidden form and submit it with the given verb, so that a plain link could issue a `DELETE`, `PATCH`, `POST` or `PUT` request. `data-turbo-method` is a drop-in replacement, so the migration is mechanical.

Once `@rails/ujs` is gone the attribute is inert, and the failure is silent rather than loud: the link still works, but it issues a `GET` to the same URL. A "Delete" link quietly turns into a link that shows the record instead of destroying it.

Note that `method:` on `button_to` and the `form_*` helpers is unaffected. Those render a real form and set the verb through a hidden `_method` field, which never involved `@rails/ujs`.

## Examples

### ✅ Good

```erb
<a href="/posts/1" data-turbo-method="delete">Delete</a>
```

```erb
<%= link_to "Delete", post_path(@post), data: { turbo_method: :delete } %>
```

```erb
<%= button_to "Delete", post_path(@post), method: :delete %>
```

### 🚫 Bad

```erb
<a href="/posts/1" data-method="delete">Delete</a>
```

```erb
<%= link_to "Delete", post_path(@post), method: :delete %>
```

```erb
<%= link_to "Delete", post_path(@post), data: { method: :delete } %>
```
