# Linter Rule: Prefer `data-turbo-submits-with` over the deprecated `data-disable-with`

**Rule:** `ujs-prefer-turbo-submits-with`

## Description

Disallow the `data-disable-with` attribute and the Action View helper option that renders it, `data: { disable_with: ... }`. Use `data-turbo-submits-with` or `data: { turbo_submits_with: ... }` instead.

## Rationale

Before Rails 7, Rails shipped `@rails/ujs` by default, which added JavaScript behavior to elements through helper options and `data-*` attributes. Rails 7 stopped including it, and Turbo covers the same behavior with its own attributes.

`data-disable-with` made `@rails/ujs` disable the submit button and swap its label for the given text while the request was in flight, which is what stopped users from double submitting a form. `data-turbo-submits-with` is a drop-in replacement, so the migration is mechanical.

Once `@rails/ujs` is gone the attribute is inert, and the failure is silent rather than loud: the form still submits, but the button stays live and keeps its original label. Double submissions become possible again on exactly the forms that were annotated to prevent them.

## Examples

### ✅ Good

```erb
<button data-turbo-submits-with="Saving...">Save</button>
```

```erb
<%= f.submit "Save", data: { turbo_submits_with: "Saving..." } %>
```

```erb
<%= submit_tag "Save", data: { turbo_submits_with: "Saving..." } %>
```

### 🚫 Bad

```erb
<button data-disable-with="Saving...">Save</button>
```

```erb
<%= f.submit "Save", data: { disable_with: "Saving..." } %>
```

```erb
<%= submit_tag "Save", data: { disable_with: "Saving..." } %>
```
