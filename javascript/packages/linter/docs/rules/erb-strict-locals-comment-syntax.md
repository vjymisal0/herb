# Linter Rule: Enforce strict locals comment syntax

**Rule:** `erb-strict-locals-comment-syntax`

## Description

Ensures that strict locals comments use the exact `locals: ( ... )` syntax so they are properly recognized by Rails and tooling. Also validates that only keyword arguments are used (no positional, block, or splat arguments).

## Rationale

Strict locals comments declare which locals are expected in a template. Misspellings or malformed syntax silently disable the declaration, leading to confusing runtime errors when required locals are missing.

Additionally, Rails only supports keyword arguments in strict locals declarations. Positional, block, and splat arguments will raise an `ActionView::Error` at render-time.

This rule catches invalid comment forms and argument types early during development.

## Autofix

Most of these offenses are corrected by `--fix`. The rewrites are safe because the declaration they replace is one Rails rejects outright.

| `<%# locals:(user:) %>`              | `<%# locals: (user:) %>`               |
| `<%# locals: %>`                     | `<%# locals: () %>`                    |
| `<%# locals: user:, admin: false %>` | `<%# locals: (user:, admin: false) %>` |
| `<%# locals: (user: %>`              | `<%# locals: (user:) %>`               |
| `<% # locals: (user:) %>`            | `<%# locals: (user:) %>`               |
| `<%# locals: (user) %>`              | `<%# locals: (user:) %>`               |
| `<%# locals: (user:,) %>`            | `<%# locals: (user:) %>`               |

A parameter list written without parentheses is wrapped in them, and any bare name in it becomes a required keyword argument, since that is the only form Rails accepts.

Block arguments, splat arguments, and duplicate declarations are reported but not corrected. Each has more than one reasonable rewrite, so the choice is left to you.

## Examples

### ✅ Good

Required keyword argument:

```erb
<%# locals: (user:) %>
```

Keyword argument with default value:

```erb
<%# locals: (user:, admin: false) %>
```

Complex default values:

```erb
<%# locals: (items: [], config: {}) %>
```

No locals (empty):

```erb
<%# locals: () %>
```

Double-splat for optional keyword arguments:

```erb
<%# locals: (message: "Hello", **attributes) %>
```

### 🚫 Bad

#### Wrong comment syntax

Missing colon after `locals`:

```erb
<%# locals() %>
```

Singular `local` instead of `locals`:

```erb
<%# local: (user:) %>
```

Missing colon before parentheses:

```erb
<%# locals (user:) %>
```

Missing parentheses around parameters:

```erb
<%# locals: user %>
```

Empty `locals:` without parentheses:

```erb
<%# locals: %>
```

Missing space after the colon:

```erb
<%# locals:(user:) %>
```

Unbalanced parentheses:

```erb
<%# locals: (user: %>
```

#### Wrong tag type (must use ERB comment tag)

Ruby comment in execution tag:

```erb
<% # locals: (user:) %>
```

#### Unsupported argument types

Positional argument (use `user:` instead):

```erb
<%# locals: (user) %>
```

Block argument:

```erb
<%# locals: (&block) %>
```

Single splat argument:

```erb
<%# locals: (*args) %>
```

Note: Double-splat (`**attributes`) IS supported for optional keyword arguments.

#### Invalid Ruby syntax

Trailing comma:

```erb
<%# locals: (user:,) %>
```

Leading comma:

```erb
<%# locals: (, user:) %>
```

Double comma:

```erb
<%# locals: (user:,, admin:) %>
```

#### Duplicate declarations

Only one `locals:` comment is allowed per partial:

```erb
<%# locals: (user:) %>
<p>Content</p>
<%# locals: (admin:) %>
```
